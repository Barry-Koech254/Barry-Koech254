- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was officially introduced to the world in 1996, while HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) has been around since the early 1990s? HTML provides the structure for web pages, and CSS adds the style and layout. Despite their age, these technologies remain fundamental building blocks of the web, proving the longevity and enduring relevance of well-established web standards.
